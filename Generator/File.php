   *    the root component class's getReplacements().
   *  - body: An array of pieces to assemble in order to form the body of the
   *    file. These can be single lines, or larger chunks: they will be joined
   *    up by assembleFiles(). The array may be keyed numerically, or the keys
   *    can be meaningful to the generator class: they are immaterial to the
   *    caller.
